Saving Abel is an American rock band from Corinth, Mississippi, founded in 2004 by Jared Weeks and Jason Null. The band is named after the biblical story of Cain and Abel, in which a man named Cain kills his brother Abel. Band member Jason Null thought up the band title saying "I Googled the story of Cain and Abel and found a line about 'there was no saving Abel,' which just jumped out at me."Lead singer Jared Weeks left the band at the end of 2013 to pursue a solo career, but returned in 2021, replacing Scott Austin.

Lead singer Jared Weeks and lead guitarist Jason Null began forming Saving Abel in the small town of Corinth, Mississippi in 2004. Weeks was learning to play the guitar at his best friend's house and Null, who was in a competing rock band in the same town, walked in to rehearse, hit it off, and several days later were writing songs together. Early in 2005, their songs caught the ear of noted producer Skidd Mills, who brought the two into his 747 Studio in Memphis, Tennessee to record some of the songs.The band gradually came together with the addition of rhythm guitarist Scott Bartlett, bassist Daniel Dwight, and drummer Blake Dixon. Weeks would throw demo CDs onto the stages of bigger bands that toured through Corinth. After shopping the album around for almost a year, and a member change as original bassist Daniel Dwight left the group, they picked up bassist and long time friend Eric Taylor.
