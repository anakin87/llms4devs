=== Letters from Chutney (1990–1996) ===
Finger Eleven first formed at Lester B. Pearson High School in Burlington, Ontario as Stone Soul Picnic, then changed their name to Rainbow Butt Monkeys. One of their first shows was at a school Christmas concert in 1990, and they won the 97.7 CHTZ (Hits) HTZ FM's Rock Search competition. At the time, the band's lineup consisted of Scott Anderson (vocals), James Black (guitar, vocals), Rick Jackett (guitar), Sean Anderson (bass), and Rob Gommerman (drums).
They were signed by Mercury Records and, after releasing four EPs, they issued the album Letters from Chutney (1995), which received generally favourable reviews. In 1996, they were taken on by the management company Coalition Entertainment.


=== Tip (1997–1999) ===
In 1997, the band changed its name to Finger Eleven, which came from a demo of their song "Thin Spirits". Their first album under the new name was Tip, produced by Arnold Lanni (Our Lady Peace). Mercury dropped the band after the album's release; they were then signed to Wind-up Records, which re-released the record in 1998. During this period, the band toured heavily, as part of Edgefest, the Vans Warped Tour and, several times, opening for Creed and Fuel.
