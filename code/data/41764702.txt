Royal Blood are  an English rock duo formed by Mike Kerr (vocals, bass guitar) and Matt Swan (drums) in Worthing in 2011. The current lineup consists of Kerr and Ben Thatcher, who replaced Swan in 2013 prior to the band being signed by Warner Records. Their sound is anchored by Kerr's unique bass playing style, which sees him using various effects pedals and amps to make his bass guitar sound like a standard electric guitar and bass guitar at the same time. Their self-titled debut album was released in August 2014, with their second album How Did We Get So Dark? following in June 2017, and their third album Typhoons in April 2021.

=== 2011–2015: Formation and debut album ===
Royal Blood consists of lead vocalist and bassist Mike Kerr (born 19 June 1990) from Worthing and drummer Ben Thatcher (born 12 February 1988) from Rustington. They first met around 2005 when they were teenagers; for a brief period, they were part of the same four-piece band called Flavour Country, in which Kerr played keyboards and the keytar.Royal Blood formed in Worthing in March 2011, after Kerr met original drummer Matt Swan. The earliest iteration of the band consisted of Kerr, Swan and guitarist Joe Dennis. Dennis left in early 2012, and was not replaced – establishing Kerr's focus on bass as the band's main instrument. They relocated to Swan's home country of Australia, where they recorded an EP in Brisbane. The first single, "Leaving", premiered on Australian radio station Triple J in 2012; it would later be re-recorded and renamed "Come On Over". The band played around the Brisbane and Gold Coast area, before Kerr eventually decided to return to Worthing. He was picked up at the airport by Thatcher, and the two decided to continue Royal Blood together with Thatcher on drums.Initially, the new duo "couldn't get a gig in Worthing for months" and "ended up just playing a lot of open-mic nights with acoustic singer-songwriters". The band developed their music in the studios of Brighton Electric, and it was during this time that they were signed by Warner/Chappell Music. They joined the same management company as the band Arctic Monkeys. During the summer of 2013, Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders wore a Royal Blood shirt during the Arctic Monkeys' Glastonbury Festival concert.On 11 November 2013, Royal Blood released their official debut single, "Out of the Black", which came with the B-side of the re-recorded "Come On Over".

Royal Blood released their second single, "Little Monster", on 11 February 2014. The band also released a four-track EP Out of the Black, featuring "Out of the Black", "Little Monster", "Come On Over" and "Hole" on 11 March 2014 in North America.
