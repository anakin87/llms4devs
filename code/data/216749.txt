== History ==


=== Formation and Saliva (1996–1999) ===
Saliva was founded in Bartlett, Tennessee (a suburb of Memphis, Tennessee) in September 1996 by former members of local bands Roxy Blue, Blackbone and Gemini Clan. The original line-up featured vocalist Josey Scott Sappington, drummer Todd Poole, bassist Dave Novotny and guitarists Chris D'Abaldo and Wayne Swinny. The band played their first show on Halloween, October 31, 1996 with Sappington dressed in a nun costume and Novotny dressed in a voodoo costume.In December 1996, only four months after forming, the band hastily recorded a demo tape, on the basis of which they were selected, out of 117 local bands, to perform at the second annual Grammy Showcase National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences' local competition. The band barely had time to finish mixing the tracks of their demo tape at Rockingchair Recording Studios in order to submit their application before the deadline. The local showcase had Saliva perform alongside four other Tennessee and Arkansas bands (DDT Big Band, Mash-o-Matic, Straight Up Buzz and Ashtray Babyhead) on January 24, 1997 at Memphis' New Daisy Tavern. Saliva ranked first place at the local showcase and advanced to the regional showcase held in Austin, Texas on February 7, 1997. Their demo tape had since been re-mixed with a better production and the song "Suffocate" was included on the 1997 Grammy Showcase Various Artists compact disc compilation, released through Grammy Recordings, alongside the eleven other bands with whom they would be competing in the regional showcases.Saliva again won first place in the regional showcase and they advanced to the national finals, held in New York City on February 22, 1997, competing against the other two regional finalists: folk trio Maggi, Pierce, and EJ and rock band Save Ferris. Saliva came in second behind Save Ferris, but still received worthy consolation prizes including money, equipment and tickets to 1997's 39th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony. By this point, Saliva had only played a total of six concerts, but they began to be courted by major record label A&R scouts.The band was nominated for Best Newcomer at the 12th Annual Premier Player Awards, the local Memphis edition of the Grammy Awards, held at The Peabody's Memphis Ballroom on April 16, 1997. Saliva also appeared at Memphis' Crossroads '97 music exhibition as part of Memphis in May's Beale Street Music Festival showcase on May 2, 1997.In the spring and summer of 1997, Saliva returned to Rockingchair Recording Studios in Memphis to record additional songs with producers Bill Pappas and Mark Yoshida, which were combined with the re-mixed songs from their demo tape into their self-titled debut album . Saliva was released on compact disc in mid-August 1997 through producer Yoshida's own independent record label Rockingchair Records. A CD-release party was held at Club 616 in Memphis on Friday, August 15, 1997. The album went on to sell over 10,000 copies within two years, prompting Island Records A&R representatives to again take notice of the band. The band's debut album was repressed following Saliva's major label success through a licensing deal between Rockingchair Records and hip hop record label Diamond Productions. The reissue was distributed by RED Distribution imprint RUMM (RED Urban Music Marketing) and featured an updated artwork designed by Brandon Seavers at AudioGraphic MasterWorks.The band performed again at Memphis' Crossroads '98 music exhibition as part of Memphis in May's Beale Street Music Festival showcase on May 3, 1998.

He then shortly retracted his statement and apologized, declaring on the band's website that "there was a bit of an issue we're working through and we're looking forward to recording a new album later this year". However, the band's website later apologized again for the confusion and confirmed that due to "creative differences", D'Abaldo was in fact leaving the band, but that Saliva was "completely moving forward as planned and [has] our best music ahead of us". D'Abaldo eventually moved on to start the band Smolder. Jake Stutevoss formerly of the band Future Leaders of the World replaced him in Saliva's tour lineup.
