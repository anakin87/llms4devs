Shortly afterwards; Kroeger invited Connolly to a barbecue and discussed giving his band a record deal soon after. They released their eponymous debut album Theory of a Deadman on September 17, 2002.

=== Wake Up Call (2017–2018) ===

In January 2017, the band announced that they were recording their sixth studio album. They released two cover singles shortly after—Sting's "Shape of My Heart" in February and Major Lazer's "Cold Water" on March 17. Instead of working with the same production team in Los Angeles that they had used for their previous four albums, they decided to work with Swedish music producer Martin Terefe, and spent seven weeks recording in London at Terefe's Kensaltown Studios. The group announced the name of their upcoming album—Wake Up Call—on July 27, 2017, with the release of its lead single, "Rx (Medicate)". The song, which handles the topic of prescription drug addiction, topped the Billboard US Mainstream Rock Songs chart for six consecutive weeks later that year, and earned the band a "No. 1 Song Award" from the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN).With the release of the new album, the band decided to undergo a name change, shortening it to Theory. The group cited that discussions involving the name of their band with people who are unfamiliar with their music was challenging. Connolly equated it to rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers frequently abbreviating their name to Chili Peppers.Wake Up Call has been described by critics as a departure from Theory of a Deadman's usual hard rock foundation, moving into pop and pop rock territory. To promote the album, the band launched a 33-city tour in the United States during the fall of 2017. The tour was extended into 2018 to include shows throughout western Canada and Europe, and the group toured in Australia for the first time in their career in June 2018. Connolly told The Music, "There's a real dichotomy of Theory now, two very different sides. Not that we want to get away from our old songs, but the new songs are so diverse, such a juxtaposition. We're really working on building a big show, and trying to make it all more visual, as well."


=== Say Nothing (2019–present) ===
The band returned to London in April 2019 to begin work on their seventh record with Terefe. In August 2019, Connolly informed the public that the group would continue their 2019 headlining tour efforts in September. On September 25, Theory of a Deadman announced their seventh album, Say Nothing, which was released on January 31, 2020; the news coincided with the release of the first single, accompanied by its music video, "History of Violence", a song that addresses domestic violence. "Strangers" was the second song to be released from Say Nothing and was released on November 8; the track examines the polarizing effect of politics on society and how current events are creating a new generation of activists. It was released simultaneously with an official animated music video.The band headlined a Canadian tour, beginning on January 31, 2020, to coincide with the release of the album. Two North American tours were scheduled in 2020—one with American band 10 Years, and the second with Breaking Benjamin, Bush, Saint Asonia, and Cory Marks.
