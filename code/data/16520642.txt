=== Early years ===
Danny O'Donoghue and Mark Sheehan have been best friends since they were 12 growing up in Dublin. They were formerly part of a boy band called Mytown, formed in 1996. Striking up a songwriting and production partnership, they were invited to Canada to collaborate with some of their heroes, including Dallas Austin, Montell Jordan and Teddy Riley.
